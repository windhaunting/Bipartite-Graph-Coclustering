# Bipartite Graph Coclustering


Bipartite graph coclustering (BGC) is to cluster a bipartite graph based on finding minimum cut vertepartitions in a bipartite graph between
them. The given data is a bipartite graph and then modeled as a two dimenional matrix. It simultaneous clusters the rows and columns of the matrix.
